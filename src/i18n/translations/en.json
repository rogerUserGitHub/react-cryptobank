Market capitalization is used to determine the ranking of cryptocurrencies. The higher the market cap of a particular crypto coin, the higher its ranking and share of the market. Crypto market cap is calculated by multiplying the total number of coins in circulation by its current price. For instance, to calculate the market cap of Ethereum, all you need to do is multiply the total number of Ethereum in circulation by the current price of one Ethereum and you will get its market cap.",
